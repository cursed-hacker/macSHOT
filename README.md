> [!IMPORTANT]
>  ```Bugs```
>	-	❗ The built-in screenshot function doesn't fully capture CSS shadows in white theme.
>		-	```html2canvas```  may not perfectly capture shadows or certain CSS properties due to its limitations.
>		-	An alternative approach is to use the ```Browser API```, though it requires requesting screen permissions.
>		-	🔹 You can also use the <a href="https://shorturl.at/SS4Sb" target="_blank">GoFullPage</a> chrome extension to take screenshots.
